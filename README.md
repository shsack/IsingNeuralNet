# Phase Classification with Neural Network

An Artificial Neural Network is used to classify the two phases of the 2D Ising model.\
Following [Machine Learning Phases of Matter](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4035) a Feed Forward Neural Network 
is trained on a 2D Ising model to classify the two phases of the model. The spin configuration is generated by sampling from a Boltzmann distribution with a Markov chain.


## Running 

### Generate training data

To run the program you first need to generate spin configurations of the 2D Ising model over a range of temperatures by 
running 

```
python3 ising_lattice.py
```

This will generate the data and store it with an additional binary label that classifies the data into high and low temperature phases.
Additionally, a plot will be generated that shows the magnetization as a function of temperature, this allows to visualize the phase transition.

### Training and testing the Neural Network

To train and test the neural network you need to run

```
python3 neural_net_ising.py
```
 
This will first train the neural network on the spin configurations and secondly test the network on a different set of data.
The output of the network is plotted as a function of temperature.
