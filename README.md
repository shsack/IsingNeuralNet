# Phase Classification with Neural Network

An Artificial Neural Network is used to classify the two phases of the 2D Ising model.__
Following [Machine Learning Phases of Matter](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4035) a Feed Forward Neural Network 
is trained on a 2D Ising model to classify the two phases of the model.__
The spin configuration is generated by sampling from a Boltzmann distribution with a Markov chain.
