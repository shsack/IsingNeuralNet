# Phase Classification with Neural Network

An Artificial Neural Network is used to classify the two phases of the 2D Ising model.\

Following [Machine Learning Phases of Matter](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4035) a Feed Forward Neural Network 
is trained on a 2D Ising model to classify the two phases of the model. The spin configuration is generated by sampling from a Boltzmann distribution with a Markov chain.


## Running 

### Generate training data

To run the program you first need to generate spin configurations of the 2D Ising model over a range of temperatures by 
running 

```
python3 ising_lattice.py
```

This will generate the data and store it with an additional binary label that classifies the data into high and low temperature phases.
Additionally, a plot will be generated that shows the magnetization as a function of temperature, this allows to visualize the phase transition.

### Training and testing the Neural Network

To train and test the neural network you need to run

```
python3 neural_net_ising.py
```
 
This will first train the neural network on the spin configurations and secondly test the network on a different set of data.
The output of the network is plotted as a function of temperature.

This shows that the neural network is able to learn the order parameter of the phase transition with very high accuracy.
Comparing the magnetization curve of the Monte Carlo simulation shows that the neural network was able to identify the magnetization as the relevant order paramter.
