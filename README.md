# Neural Network Phase Classification
An Artificial Neural Network is used to classify the two phases of the 2D Ising model.

## The Neural Network
A simple feed forward neural newtwork is implemented *tensorflow* and *sklearn*.

## Ising Model
The spin configuration of the Ising model is sampled with a Markov chain.
